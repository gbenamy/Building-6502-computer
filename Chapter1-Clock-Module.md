# Chapter 1 - The Clock Module
## Building a stable, monostable, and bistable computer clock using 555 timer


Following Ben Eater's [clock module](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRlSFm519Bo) youtube and [kit](https://eater.net/6502)

The computerâ€™s clock is used to synchronize all operations. 
This clock is based on the popular 555 timer IC.

The clock is adjustable-speed (from less than 1Hz to a few hundred Hz). The clock can also be put into a manual mode where you push a button to advance each clock cycle. This will be a really useful feature for debugging the computer later on.
